    <p> I realize that my project content is quite unprofessional, but considering how little I currently know about all of this I felt odd being more serious about the content. I wouldn't have gotten anything done if I was just trying to figure out how to be a serious professional about it considering I have zero credentials. So please don't take the irreverent nature of the project content to mean that I don't take the class seriously, because that is not the case.</p>
